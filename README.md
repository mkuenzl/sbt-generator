# sbt-table-generator
 
This is a pure java application, that automates the creation process of word tables. 
To use this application, download the .exe from the latest release.

- Generate a new excel template.
- Fill the excel template with data.
- Update the first excel page, with the update data button in excel.
- Export the first page as csv.
- Load the csv into the application.
- Choose a template.
- Generate. 
- Open the .html with word.

Seems like a lot of steps.
